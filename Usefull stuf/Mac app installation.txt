There are three main types of certificate:
	- Mac Development Certificate – Optional for general app development, but required if the developer plans to use features like iCloud 	or push notifications. The developer will need a Development Certificate before they can create Provisioning Profiles that allow 		them to access those features.
	- Mac App Store – The developer will need a certificate for their app and another certificate for the installer.	
	- Developer ID – Certificates for the app and installer if choosing to distribute outside the Mac App Store.
